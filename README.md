# 👋 Oh, Hey There!  

I'm DanG115, your friendly neighborhood coder who loves making the web a better (and sometimes weirder) place.

## 🖥️ About Me  

- 🎨 I turn boring websites into eye candy with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- 🐍 I build Discord bots with Python because who doesn't want a bot friend?  
- 😎 I’m all about cool projects, bad jokes, and good code.

## 🔧 My Toolbox  

- 🛠️ **HTML, CSS, JS**: Making websites that don’t just work—they *wow*.  
- 🐍 **Python**: Creating bots that do my bidding (and yours too, probably).  
- 🎉 **Fun Ideas**: Sometimes they work, sometimes they crash. It's a vibe.
