## 🔥 My Totally-Useful Creations  

1. [**QuickHTML**](https://github.com/DanG115/QuickHTML) – A Visual Studio Code extension that was cool enough to make it to the marketplace.   
2. [**SnowFall**](https://github.com/DanG115/snow-fall) – Add some cozy snow to your website because why not? 
3. [**Customizable Loaders**](https://github.com/DanG115/websiteloader-v2) – Fancy spinners for fancy people.  
4. [**Voltage Bot**](https://github.com/DanG115/Voltage-Bot-23) – A Discord bot with too much personality. Gone but not forgotten.  
5. [**Bing Redirector**](https://github.com/DanG115/Bing-Redirector) – Because I refuse to let Bing stand between me and YouTube.
