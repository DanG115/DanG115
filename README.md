# 👋 Just DanG115  

I’m DanG115, a front-end web dev. I spend my time turning questionable ideas into code—sometimes it works, sometimes it’s chaos. Either way, it’s fun.

## 🖥️ About Me  

- 🎨 I turn plain, boring websites into works of art (or something close to it) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- 🐍 I build Discord bots because every good dev needs an army of digital minions.  
- 😎 My hobbies include making *completely unnecessary* but surprisingly fun projects like redirecting Bing Videos or snowing on web pages.

## 🔧 What’s in My Dev Toolbox?  

- 🛠️ **HTML, CSS, JS**: Making websites that wow (or at least don’t crash).  
- 🐍 **Python**: Writing bots that sometimes do what they’re told.  
- 🎉 **Random Ideas**: Useless but oddly satisfying experiments, like QuickHTML and Bing Redirector.
